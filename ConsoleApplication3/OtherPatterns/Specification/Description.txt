Specification pattern is a pattern that allows us to encapsulate some piece of 
domain knowledge into a single unit – specification – and reuse it in different parts of the code base.

There are 3 main use cases for the Specification pattern:

	- Looking up data in the database. That is finding records that match the specification we have in hand.
    
	- Validating objects in the memory. In other words, checking that an object we retrieved or created fits the spec.
    
	- Creating a new instance that matches the criteria. This is useful in scenarios where you don’t care 
	  about the actual content of the instances, but still need it to have certain attributes.


Pros:

1) follow DRY principle
2) easy to modify and reuse everywhere

Cons:

NO
